    "\n",
    "This project introduces basic image classification techniques using the [CIFAR10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). This project has two parts. [Part 1](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep576/20sp/projects/Project3_1.html) uses Numpy to implement basic image classifiers using simple linear algebra operations. [Part 2](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep576/20sp/projects/Project3_2.html) uses Tensorflow to implement convolutional neural networks using the Keras API. Part 1 is worth 60%, and Part 2 worth 40% of the overall mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Getting Started:** The source files for this project are [here](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/csep576/20sp/projects/project3/project3.zip). To run locally you will need IPython/Jupyter installed, see instructions at http://jupyter.org/install.html. Launch Jupyter and open `Project3_1.ipynb`. You can also import the standalone version of this notebook `standalone\\Project3_1.ipynb` into [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "**This project:** You'll build nearest mean and nearest neighbour classifiers and test their performance. Next you'll build a linear classifier, first via least squares, then stochastic gradient descent, and investigate the effect of learning rate and momentum.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What to turn in:** Hand in a zipfile containing your completed .ipynb notebook and any source .py files you created. Be sure to describe clearly the results of your investigations in your notebook. \n",

If the dataset is really large, or the parameter space is big, or the classifier is non-linear, this approach no longer works. In the following, we we solve the same problem using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This works by selecting a subset of data and taking a step in the direction of the gradient of the loss function $L(W)$. To start, work out the gradient of the loss with regularization used above, i.e., $\\frac{dL}{dW}$. Then set up a loop where the weights are modified by $\\alpha\\frac{dL}{dW}$ where $\\alpha$ is the learning rate. Note that the regularization parameter $\\lambda$ is often called 'weight decay' in the context of SGD for reasons which should become clear. Experiment with the learning rate and make sure you can get the validation accuracy to increase. Note: SGD solver packages may not be used in your answer, but can optionally be used to compare your results."
